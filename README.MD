# Weather App
I have created a Weather App using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with API integration.

## API Key 
1. Search for "OpenWeather" in your browser.
2. Visit the OpenWeather website (link: https://openweathermap.org/).
3. On the website's navbar, click on the "API" option.
4. Select "Current Weather Data" on the API documentation page.
5. Scroll down and find the "Built-in API request by city name" option.
6. Copy the first API URL.

# In this URL, you need to add an API key.

## To obtain an API key, go to your profile settings and click on "My API Key". In this section, you will find a default API key that you want to activate, and then you can use it in the URL.
